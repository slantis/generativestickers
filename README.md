# THE STORY BEHIND
slantis is a unique and diverse world. Brimmed with flowing energy, vibrant connections, and flourishing collaboration. Where the final product is all about collective construction. A place where everyone is as fundamental for it to function.

We are merging the architecture world with the technology world, so we foster a disruptive mindset which seeks to create new things and to stay ahead of the game.

The purpose of this project was mainly to create a product combining our main passions, the team, our values, but most importantly our daily collaboration spirit.

This year, with Autodesk University 2022 coming up and our team attending, the project got a clearer output: a generative design sticker.

An awesome piece of swag integrating technology, art, collaboration, innovation, and teamwork.

So, take a look at the specifics!

# THE CODE
We started our code based on http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_2_2_6_03

Used https://github.com/zenozeng/p5.js-svg to set SVG output.

To make everyone on the /slantis team part of this project we made our points match to data from our main platform of communication: Slack.

Using Slack Analytics we extracted from our headquarters channel:
- Quantity of members reactions and comments per month
- Quantity of team members per month

We set this data on the variables:
- Pendulum color to match /slantis colors
- Pendulum path points represent /slantis team comments and reactions
- Quantity of the pendulum joints reflect /slantis team growth
## HOW TO USE IT

Thi code sets a drawing tool that moves a pendulum contraption along paths drawn by a set of points.
